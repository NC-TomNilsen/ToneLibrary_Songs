# ToneLibrary_Songs
Due to copyright laws, we probably can't put most of these songs in our devices. Despite it being unlikely that someone would hear the song and decide to
sue, we will just play it safe and only put royalty-free, copyright-free music in our devices.

That being said, here are some song "arrays" that you can put into the Tone Library and play on a Piezo-electric buzzer. You're welcome to write your own
as well. See the wiki-guide on the Tone Library to see how to do that.

Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture is copyright-free and thus is the default "Party-Mode" song that devices with the Tone Library can play.
